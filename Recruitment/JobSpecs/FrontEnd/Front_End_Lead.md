# Job Spec - Front End Engineering Lead

* Buildit expect its people to be the best they can be, whilst attempting to behave decently along the way.

* We like T-shaped individuals that can lead a project whist serving within a team.

* People that can both foster a great team culture and thrive inside that team as an egoless peer.

* Our people share problems as well as victories and understand that fostering an environment of openness, transparency and fairness is the best way to keep a customer satisfied, and deliver disruptive innovation.

* Buildit Engineers optimise at the value chain level rather than sub-optimise at the component level.

* Buildit Engineers focus on the outcome rather than the output.

* Buildit Engineers encourage themselves and the team to use the right tool for the job. They are not wedded to technologies or techniques and understand that the loose coupling and high cohesion is a principal that can equally applied to team dynamics as well as software development.

* Buildit Engineers derive their satisfaction from the success of the whole over the success of the one, they are happy working in an entirely flat structure where everyone is their peer. When leadership is required a Buildit Engineer will lead from a position of trust and respect, the team will follow because they want to not because they have to.

* Buildit Engineers understand to truly transform companies they need to be confident enough to be a clients critical friend. They need to help them see when they are making ill informed decisions or focussing their time in the wrong areas. They will do this with tact and diplomacy but also openness and fairness that will prioritise long term relationships over short term appeasement.
